## Testing out how to add text using the iPad bluetooth keyboard

Adding some text to the file using Textastic.  I opened this file from Working Copy
so let's see whether it can round trip properly.  Sure would be cool if that worked as expected.
This would make a great "distraction free" writer, too.  Let's see whether that is realistic.
I'm emacs, emacs, emacs all the time and this isn't emacs.  

I guess I could use this thing for raw text entry and then use my _precious_ to format 
and re-work the text.

I do need to get the emacs issue solved so that I can develop clojure and whatnot.  I like the idea
that I can use paredit.

It's nice and all, but it's hardly the "live" experience I want.

So what I'll do is use Prompt to get back to an emacs session running on aws or something.
I'll make sure to add the files to my git repository so I can get to them from Working Copy.
As long as I push the files back to the repository, I'm fine.

That lets me work on stuff across my mac, remote Linux machine, and iPad as needed.  It'll be
pretty schweet if I can actually get it working.

## Working with the Apple Bluetooth keyboard

I wonder how long a set of batteries works on this thing.  I don't want to be at the office and
have the keyboard go dead on me.  Maybe the best answer is to keep a set of spare batteries in my bag as replacements.

## Thinking in Markdown

Interesting the way the editor wraps lines.  Might take some getting used to.  Markdown doesn't
care about line endings.  Maybe if I just turn off line wrap indenting it'll be closer to what I expect.

Yeah, I like it better with indenting turned off.  It'd be nice to have a more configrable editor
available, though, so I could set stuff up the way I want.
